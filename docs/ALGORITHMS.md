## Object Detection

### Algorithm: YOLOv5 (You Only Look Once v5)

#### Why YOLOv5?

YOLOv5 was selected for this application for several key reasons:

1. **Real-time Performance**: YOLOv5 can process 30+ FPS on modest hardware, essential for real-time UAV operations
2. **Accuracy**: High detection accuracy even for small objects at distance
3. **Single-stage Detection**: Unlike two-stage detectors (R-CNN family), YOLO processes the entire image in one pass
4. **Scalability**: Multiple model sizes (s, m, l, x) allow trading accuracy for speed
5. **Robustness**: Performs well under varying lighting and viewing angles

#### How It Works

```
Input Image (640x480)
        ↓
    Backbone (CSPDarknet53)
        ↓
    Neck (PANet)
        ↓
    Head (Detection layers)
        ↓
    Output: [class, confidence, bbox]
```

**Key Components:**

1. **Backbone**: Extracts features at multiple scales
2. **Neck**: Aggregates features from different levels (PANet)
3. **Head**: Predicts bounding boxes, classes, and confidence scores

**Detection Process:**
- Image divided into grid (e.g., 20x20)
- Each grid cell predicts multiple bounding boxes
- Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) removes duplicate detections
- Confidence threshold filters low-quality detections

#### Suitability for 10m Altitude Detection

At 10m altitude with a 60° FOV camera:
- Ground coverage: ~11.5m x 8.6m
- Tank size: ~4m x 2.5m
- Tank occupies: ~30-40% of image width
- **Excellent detection conditions** - object is large in frame

**Advantages at this altitude:**
- Large object size in pixels (>200px width)
- Clear view with minimal occlusion
- Consistent lighting from above
- Minimal motion blur at search speed

#### Fallback Detection

When YOLOv5 is unavailable, a color-based detection method is used:

```python
1. Convert image to grayscale
2. Threshold for dark objects (tanks are typically dark)
3. Morphological operations to clean noise
4. Find contours
5. Filter by size and aspect ratio
6. Return bounding boxes
```

This fallback is less accurate but ensures system functionality.

## Object Tracking

### Algorithm: DeepSORT (Deep Learning + Simple Online Realtime Tracking)

#### Why DeepSORT?

1. **Identity Preservation**: Maintains consistent track IDs across frames
2. **Occlusion Handling**: Continues tracking through brief occlusions
3. **Re-identification**: Can recover lost tracks using appearance features
4. **Proven Performance**: Industry standard for multi-object tracking

#### Architecture

```
Detections → Association → Kalman Filter → Track Management
                ↓              ↓
         Feature Matching   Motion Prediction
```

#### Key Components

**1. Kalman Filter for Motion Prediction**

State vector: `[x, y, w, h, vx, vy, vw, vh]`
- Position: (x, y) - bounding box center
- Size: (w, h) - bounding box dimensions
- Velocity: (vx, vy, vw, vh) - rates of change

**Prediction Step:**
```
x(k+1) = F * x(k)
P(k+1) = F * P(k) * F^T + Q
```

**Update Step:**
```
K = P * H^T * (H * P * H^T + R)^-1
x = x + K * (z - H * x)
P = (I - K * H) * P
```

Where:
- F: State transition matrix
- P: Covariance matrix
- Q: Process noise
- R: Measurement noise
- H: Measurement matrix
- K: Kalman gain

**2. Data Association**

Combines two distance metrics:

**a) IoU (Intersection over Union) Distance:**
```
IoU = Area(bbox1 ∩ bbox2) / Area(bbox1 ∪ bbox2)
distance_iou = 1 - IoU
```

**b) Feature Distance:**
```
distance_feature = 1 - cosine_similarity(feature1, feature2)
```

**Combined Cost:**
```
cost = λ₁ * distance_iou + λ₂ * distance_feature
```

**3. Track Management**

Track states:
- **Tentative**: New track, not yet confirmed (< 3 frames)
- **Confirmed**: Reliable track (≥ 3 consecutive detections)
- **Lost**: No detection for current frame
- **Deleted**: Lost for > 30 frames

**State Transitions:**
```
New Detection → Tentative → Confirmed → Lost → Deleted
                    ↓           ↓
                 (< 3 frames) (≥ 3 frames)
```

#### Handling Edge Cases

**1. Occlusion:**
- Kalman filter predicts position during occlusion
- Track marked as "lost" but not deleted
- Can recover when object reappears

**2. Target Leaving Frame:**
- Track continues with predicted position
- Marked as lost after leaving frame
- Can be re-identified when returning

**3. Similar Objects:**
- Appearance features distinguish similar objects
- Feature history maintains identity
- Cosine similarity threshold prevents swaps

---

## Re-Identification

### Purpose
Recover correct target identity after temporary loss of visual contact.

### Method: Appearance-Based Re-ID

#### Feature Extraction

**Color Histogram Features:**
```python
1. Extract detection region from image
2. Resize to 64x64 pixels
3. Compute color histograms:
   - Blue channel: 32 bins
   - Green channel: 32 bins
   - Red channel: 32 bins
4. Concatenate: 96-dimensional feature vector
5. L2 normalize
```

**Why Color Histograms?**
- Robust to small position changes
- Computationally efficient
- Effective for vehicles (distinctive colors)
- Invariant to rotation

#### Re-ID Process

```
Lost Track → Feature History → Compare with New Detections
                                        ↓
                            Cosine Similarity < threshold?
                                        ↓
                                   Re-identify!
```

**Algorithm:**
```python
for each lost_track:
    if lost_track.frames_lost < 10:
        for each new_detection:
            for each historical_feature in lost_track.history:
                similarity = cosine_similarity(
                    historical_feature, 
                    new_detection.feature
                )
                if similarity > threshold:
                    # Re-identification successful
                    assign new_detection to lost_track
                    mark as re-identified
```

#### Re-ID Scenarios

**Scenario 1: Target Leaves Frame**
```
Frame 100: Target detected, tracked
Frame 101-105: Target outside frame, track "lost"
Frame 106: Target re-enters frame
         → Feature matching identifies as same target
         → Track ID preserved
```

**Scenario 2: Temporary Occlusion**
```
Frame 200: Target visible
Frame 201-203: Target behind building
Frame 204: Target reappears
         → Kalman prediction + feature matching
         → Correct re-identification
```

**Scenario 3: Multiple Similar Objects**
```
Two tanks in scene:
- Tank A: Track ID 1, feature vector F1
- Tank B: Track ID 2, feature vector F2

If Tank A lost:
- Compare new detections with F1
- Cosine similarity distinguishes from Tank B
- Correct assignment maintained
```

## Trajectory Planning

### Multi-Phase Approach

#### Phase 1: Takeoff
**Algorithm:** Simple altitude controller
```python
while current_altitude < target_altitude:
    velocity_z = k_p * (target_altitude - current_altitude)
    velocity_z = clip(velocity_z, 0, max_ascent_rate)
```

**Parameters:**
- Target altitude: 10m
- Proportional gain: 1.0
- Max ascent rate: 1.0 m/s

#### Phase 2: Search Pattern
**Algorithm:** Expanding Square Spiral

```python
def generate_search_pattern(start_pos, initial_size, num_loops):
    waypoints = []
    size = initial_size
    
    for loop in range(num_loops):
        # Right
        waypoints.append((x + size, y, z))
        # Forward
        waypoints.append((x + size, y + size, z))
        # Left
        waypoints.append((x - size, y + size, z))
        # Back
        waypoints.append((x - size, y - size, z))
        # Return
        waypoints.append((x, y - size, z))
        
        size += increment
    
    return waypoints
```

**Why Expanding Square?**
- Systematic coverage of area
- Returns near start point each loop
- Increasing radius ensures full coverage
- Simple to implement and debug

**Waypoint Navigation:**
```python
while not at_waypoint:
    error = waypoint - current_position
    distance = norm(error)
    
    if distance < tolerance:
        next_waypoint()
    else:
        velocity = (speed / distance) * error
        publish(velocity)
```

#### Phase 3: Tracking
**Algorithm:** Visual Servoing (Image-Based)

**Goal:** Keep target centered in camera frame

```python
# Image center (for 640x480 image)
center_x, center_y = 320, 240

# Target center
target_x = bbox.x + bbox.width / 2
target_y = bbox.y + bbox.height / 2

# Error in pixels
error_x = target_x - center_x
error_y = target_y - center_y

# Control law (proportional)
velocity_x = k_p * error_y  # Forward/back
velocity_y = k_p * error_x  # Left/right
velocity_z = 0  # Maintain altitude
```

**Coordinate Mapping:**
- Camera is downward-facing (90° pitch)
- Positive error_x (right in image) → move right (positive y)
- Positive error_y (down in image) → move forward (positive x)

#### Phase 4: Approach
**Algorithm:** Visual Servoing + Proportional Descent

```python
# Lateral control (same as tracking)
velocity_x = k_p * error_y
velocity_y = k_p * error_x

# Descent control
if current_altitude > engagement_altitude:
    velocity_z = -descent_rate
else:
    velocity_z = 0

# Velocity limiting
velocity = clip(velocity, -max_vel, max_vel)
```

**Adaptive Descent:**
Could be enhanced with:
```python
# Proportional to altitude error
altitude_error = current_altitude - engagement_altitude
velocity_z = -k_z * altitude_error

# Or proportional to target size (closer = larger)
target_size = bbox.width * bbox.height
velocity_z = -k_size * (desired_size - target_size)
```

### Response to Computer Vision Feedback

**Detection Quality → Flight Behavior:**

| Vision State | Flight Response |
|--------------|----------------|
| No detection | Continue search pattern |
| Detection (low confidence) | Slow down, verify |
| Detection (high confidence) | Switch to tracking |
| Target centered | Begin approach |
| Target off-center | Adjust position |
| Target lost | Hover, attempt re-ID |
| Target re-identified | Resume tracking |

**Feedback Loop:**
```
Vision System → Target State → Flight Controller → UAV Motion
      ↑                                                ↓
      └────────────── Camera Feed ←──────────────────┘
```

**Control Frequency:**
- Vision processing: 30 Hz
- Flight control: 20 Hz
- Asynchronous communication via ROS topics

## Visual Servoing

### Image-Based Visual Servoing (IBVS)

**Principle:** Control robot motion directly from image features

**Advantages:**
- No 3D reconstruction needed
- Robust to calibration errors
- Direct feedback from sensor

**Control Law:**
```
v = -λ * L⁺ * e

where:
v = velocity command
λ = gain
L⁺ = pseudo-inverse of interaction matrix
e = error in image space
```

**Simplified Implementation:**
```python
# Error: difference between current and desired image position
e_x = current_x - desired_x
e_y = current_y - desired_y

# Proportional control
v_x = -k_p * e_y  # Note: coordinate transformation
v_y = -k_p * e_x

# Velocity limiting for stability
v = saturate(v, v_max)
```

**Stability Considerations:**
- Proportional gain tuning: k_p = 0.002
- Velocity saturation: ±1.0 m/s
- Deadband around center: ±50 pixels
- Low-pass filtering for smooth motion

### Coordinate Frame Transformations

```
World Frame (Gazebo):
  X: forward
  Y: left
  Z: up

UAV Body Frame:
  X: forward
  Y: left
  Z: up

Camera Frame (downward-facing):
  X: right (in image)
  Y: down (in image)
  Z: into scene (down in world)

Image Frame:
  u: horizontal (0-640)
  v: vertical (0-480)
  Origin: top-left
```

**Transformation:**
```python
# Image error to body velocity
# Camera rotated 90° pitch (looking down)
v_body_x = k_p * error_image_v  # Image down → body forward
v_body_y = k_p * error_image_u  # Image right → body right
```
